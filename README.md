About
-----
From Udacity:
> In this project, you will continue your work on operationalizing microservices by deploying an elastic and fault-tolerant Machine Learning inference API using Kubernetes. Youâ€™ll configure this microservice to be highly available by using Kubernetes best practices. You will validate your design by load testing the service and verifying the application architecture performs as designed.
